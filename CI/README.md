
This app has the objective of demonstrating the Confidence Intervals theory and familiarize the user with the related variables.
 
The user can change parameters such as Significance level, mean, number of intervals, sample size and standard deviation.

The App generates randomic values of samples and then, acording with the parameters, plots the intervals, marking with red the ones that doesn't contain the mean value, and with green the ones that contain. The number of red intervals tend to be proportional to the value of significance level and the number of intervals tested (Intervals * Significance).

By pressing the play buttons the user can see in a dyinamic way how the plot changes with the variation of one parameter.
